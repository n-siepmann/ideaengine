# Idea Engine
This is a daily idea-generation exercise to encourage me to exercise my creativity in 2023! It uses the Tarot as a library of ideas, and draws two cards daily to act as a prompt for the user to come up with ideas. These ideas can then be saved for future reference, and saved ideas can be marked as complete, or deleted from the list. Unsaved ideas will be deleted 14 days after creation, and completed ideas 7 days after completion. 

The service also offers optional daily reminder emails to use the service, and weekly reminders to review your past ideas. Security is provided by OAuth2 with Google login.

## A note on Tarot
I have written the card descriptions myself using a synthesis of the guide included in The Fountain Tarot deck and the descriptions of the Rider-Waite deck on tarotmysterium.com. While I have attempted to preserve the spirit of each card's traditional meaning, my descriptions are to be used more as a guide for creativity than as an authoritative record of the practice and tradition of Tarot.
